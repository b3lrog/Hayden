She's just annoying for no good reason, but annoying characters seem to get a pass if they're a "cute" girl. You can make a character energetic without being annoying. If Wutai was completely run down and shabby maybe I'd have some sympathy but not only does it look completely fine, it's quite pretty and in way better condition than Sector 7 was. Actually it seems better than where I live irl lol. She adds nothing to the story or cast and is actively mean to Barret too.<br/>Tifa is by far my favorite in the OG and Aerith is by far my favorite in the Remake, she barely felt like a character in the OG. But yeah, Yuffie sucks and her fans go rabid if you dare dislike her cuz she's so quirky teehee<br/>Only talking about OG Yuffie I haven't played her Remake DLC            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/3994.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1543361387952.jpg" class="media" title="Jun 07 14:21">                        <div class="subject">mog</div>                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">20 replies</span><br/>                mog - Multiplayer Online General<br/>This thread was made so people can post about any game that supports multiplayer online and to make it easier to find others to play with.<br/><br/><br/>I just started playing FFXIV and made a Lalafell because they are so small and cute.

They are a new advancement in technology that some cam girls are using. They employ Webcam, full body trackers, and of course voice  changers to give the appearance of anime girls. Is this the future of what is considered entertainment? Is this somehow tied to the metaverse that is an overall plan for tech companies to sell? Is this good or bad for society in general? Do you even watch vtubers or know who any of them are?            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/6308.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1592197409512.jpg" class="media" title="Mar 25 15:46">                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">47 replies</span><br/>                How do you feel about Mecha?

I'm also surprised Vacuumchan didn't say anything since she was involved as the lead artist.

Goblin Slayer this season is interesting enough that I think I'll keep watching for now, but the violence is Elfen Lied-tier graphic and voyeuristic. Like for example, the camera pans to a puddle of blood during a scene where nonhuman fantasy creatures are killed but nude human women get raped and stabbed on camera. I think the story could be told just as well without being quite so graphic; it kind of bothers me that is seems like those scenes of sexual violence were meant to be fanservice.            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/29922.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1678184289851.jpeg" class="media" title="Mar 07 14:10">                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">5 replies</span><br/>                Do you find these words incredible?<br/><br/>What do you think about works of women who are poets?

I could go only to episode 2 and I already feel like I've seen the entire show. It's the most graphic anime I've seen so far.<br/>I've actually read the original Devilman manga, and I found it for adorable because of the cute artstyle, and I've also read Devilman Lady which I also liked.<br/>Devilman Crybaby was too extreme and gross for me, and I despise what they've done to Fudou Akira (the black-haired protagonist who is Devilman) - they turned him into a male's wetdream, who has all the girls chasing him and has the perfect physique and completely eroded his charming personality he had in the manga (I don't know if he becomes a better character since I've seen only two episodes).

I'm 29 years old, older than most miners I believe and I still like the very same things I used to when I was a teen. None of my highschool friends, who liked the very same things as me,  like it anymore. I don't think it has anything to do with time as I probably work harder than most of them and hang out just as much (even though that's not <em>that</em> much when compared to the average person). Also now they're into other media (mostly western Netflix TV shows) that require lots of time too. <br/><br/>So, I was just wondering. Are anime, games, metal and things like this actually made for kids? Why do people stop liking them after/during college. About metal I can understand, most of your angst is gone, but the others still might be fun. Do you think it might have something to do with how society sees people with the so called "manchild" hobbies?            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/17531.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1609967408840.jpg" class="media" title="Aug 22 08:01">                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">9 replies</span><br/>                Who is your favorite writer? <br/><span class="quote">&gt;inb4 this thread gets moved to /media/</span>            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/19949.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1626041209901.jpg" class="media" title="Aug 21 10:43">                        <div class="subject">Music with vampire energy </div>                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">36 replies</span><br/>                I'm mostly just bored and hoping people have some goth/darkwave music recommendations for me.

I never played TS3 because I <strong>hated</strong> the pudding faces and didn't like how different it felt from TS2 but TS4 misses too many features. Thankfully the Vampire pack saves it for me.<br/><br/><br/>But the Sims community is so lame for me now. I miss the hard-working &amp; dedicated CC creators and I miss how invested people used to be in supernaturals. Basically, I miss it when it was more niche and underground.            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/1580.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1509920697168.jpg" class="media" title="Feb 17 00:21">                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">76 replies</span><br/>                What TV shows are you watching right now, anons? Let's give each other recommendations!<br/><br/><br/>I just started watching Alias Grace (pic related) and it's so good that I just had to share it with someone. It's a really great representation of what Irish people went through around the time of the Famine, especially the scenes on the coffin ships and the family dynamics. It's pretty upsetting but it's refreshingly realistic for once. I've also been loving the positive female friendship and feminist themes.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed The Handmaid's Tale or any kind of period dramas like Downton Abbey (although it's a lot more dark than this). Or even anyone who would like to see a less optimistic and darker version of Brooklyn.            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/682.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1500504887771.jpeg" class="media" title="Feb 16 22:44">                        <div class="subject">Magical Girl General</div>                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">18 replies</span><br/>                Most of us grew up with the genre so I thought we could start off with nostalgia and childhood memories~<br/><span class="quote"><br/>&gt;Which series/dubs did you watch on television?</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Did you ever get into Japanese releases?</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Favorite series/characters from your childhood?</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Favorite series/characters overall (including recent releases, reboots etc)?</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Are you currently watching anything?</span>            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/4889.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1558710047802.jpg" class="media" title="Feb 14 05:47">                        <div class="subject">Idol Games</div>                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">14 replies</span><br/>                Thread for discussing all kinds of idol games and media (Bandori, <span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="327b5f7241">[email&#160;protected]</span>, LL, Enstars, etc.)<br/><span class="quote"><br/>&gt;Best girl(s)?</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Favorite units?</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Favorite events?</span><br/><span class="quote">&gt;Favorite cards?</span>            </div>        </div>    </a>    <a href="/media/res/3302.html" class="catalog-link">        <div class="thread">                <img src="/media/thumb/1535476721816.jpg" class="media" title="Jan 11 04:29">                        <div class="replies">                <span class="reply-count">14 replies</span><br/>                Let's talk about anime -dere types and other moe character archetypes.
